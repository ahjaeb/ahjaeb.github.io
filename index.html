            Introduction to the TV Show
        </h1>
        <p>The show I selected and watched was Law and Order: SVU. Set in New York City, the show follows detectives of a new elite force: the Special Victims Unit,
         who investigate and prosecute various sexually oriented crimes. They also investigate children abuse, disabled and elderly victims of non-sexual crimes 
         who might need special handling (IMBD). The series often uses stories that are based on real crimes; however, they change details to make them fictional. 
         The stories touch on the political and societal topics of gender identity, sexual preferences, and equality rights. If the victim is alive, they play 
         significant roles in the episodes.</p>
