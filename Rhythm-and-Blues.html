            An Overview of R&B
        </h3>
        <p>R&B (Rhythm and Blues) is a very diverse genre of music. The term dated back to the 1940s and 
        began to describe all African American music that was secular. African American swing, jazz, pop, 
        and blues influenced this genre and shaped what we hear today. Additionally, gospel music served as 
        a huge source of inspiration for this genre. R&B emphasized rhythms over the instrumental and harmonic 
        nature of swing orchestras. It adopts emotionally driven vocalists, which prompted many acapella 
        groups and acts. This genre is significant to society because it helped grow African American culture 
        and promote racial acceptance and integration in a society of white people. It also influenced future music 
        styles in society, such as rock and roll.</p>

            Contemporary R&B music is the next generation of Rhythm and Blues. As always in different eras, 
            art and especially music is subject to environmental changes from generation to generation and is 
            constantly changing. Rhythm and blues are a popular style of music that originated in the 1940s and 
            also hip hop music 30 years later in the 1970s. Also, hip hop music was formed 30 years later 
            in the 1970s. However, hip hop music, especially rap, which is a kind of singing technique, can be 
            linked in some way to rhythm and blues music. In the 1990s, he reunited with the same music and with 
            and combined with pop, soul, funk and electronic music create a more modern style which is one of the 
            most popular music designs in various forms to date and most of us have memories with it.</p>
