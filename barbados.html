        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The island was uninhabited when first settled by the British in <time datetime="1627">1627</time>. African slaves worked the 
            sugar plantations established on the island, which initially dominated the Caribbean sugar industry. 
            By <time datetime="1720">1720</time>, Barbados was no longer a dominant force within the sugar industry, having been surpassed 
            by the Leeward Islands and Jamaica. </p>
        <p>Slavery was abolished in <time datetime="1834">1834</time>. The Barbadian economy remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum, 
            and molasses production through most of the 20th century. The gradual introduction of social 
            and political reforms in the <time datetime="1940s">1940s</time> and <time datetime="1950s">1950s</time> led to complete independence from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> in <time datetime="1950s">1950s</time> </p>
        <p>In the <time datetime="1990s">1990s</time>, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic importance. 
            Barbados became a republic on <time datetime="2021-11-30">November 30, 2021</time>, with the former Governor-General Sandra MASON 
            elected as the first president. Barbados plans to create a new constitution in <time datetime="2022">2022</time>. </p>
